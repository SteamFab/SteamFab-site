We work with you for 4 to 12 months and often with a round of financing as the desired milestone.</p>
                    <p>We don’t require a fixed percentage of equity compensation. 
Instead,  we craft an individual deal based on a mix of cash and equity that works for you.</p>

                    <h3>Founder team</h3>
                  <p>Our founders are passionate. We look for a balance between technical and non-technical founders. A team of two to three is ideal.
You fully understand why you want to go to the U.S. and you are committed. </p>

                    <h3>Financing</h3>
                  <p>You have raised seed financing in your local market from a diverse group of business angles or institutional investors.
The founding team still owns at least 60% of the equity.</p>

                    <h3>Product</h3>
                  <p>We optimize for product - market fit and our approach is driven by metrics.
We are guided by benchmarks for both B2B and B2C offerings, addressing a global market.</p>

                    <h3>Business model</h3>
                  <p>We expect you to have validated your business model in your local market. You should be able to have some metrics to show.
We discount the business plan in favor of unit economics and user engagement metrics. Simplicity trumps complexity.</p>

                  <p>We emphasize scale both for customer acquisition and product delivery.
