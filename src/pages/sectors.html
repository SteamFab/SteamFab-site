We work with you for 4 to 12 months and often with a round of financing as the desired milestone.</p>
                    <p>We don’t require a fixed percentage of equity compensation. 
Instead,  we craft an individual deal based on a mix of cash and equity that works for you.</p>

                  <p>Our founders are passionate and coachable. We look for a balance between technical and non-technical founders. A team of two to three is ideal.
You fully understand why you want to go to the U.S. and you are committed. </p>
