                  <h2>It is about more than just experience</h2>
                    <p>The biggest challenge to every company is to build a product that users love. Marketing cannot compensate for lack of demand and product-market fit, but marketing can greatly amplify success. At the end a company's culture is reflected in how marketing and product iteration go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Thinker first, then hustler</p>

                                  <p>Started programming as a teenager. Got a Ph.D. in Physics. Became a startup guy before it was cool. Created my first ‘startup’ inside a large company, breaking all the rules. Did it again. Found my calling creating and managing products. Moved trans-atlantic three times in pursuit of opportunity and happiness. Now our kids are trilingual. Settled in Boston - at least for now.</p>

<p>Have been involved with four tech startups, Syndesis, Pingtel, Bluesocket, eZuce, both as founder/CEO and VPM. Ran a $300m product group at a large company after getting acquired. Most proud of the teams I built.</p>

<p>I was a founding member of Vesbridge Partners, an early stage VC firm in Boston. Learned about getting into and getting out of investments.
Experienced the pain of pivots and found satisfaction in working with our companies hands-on. Now I know about life at the other end of the table.</p>
