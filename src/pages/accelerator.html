          <h2>An individually tailored program</h2>
          <p>Often it is said that startups can only get big in the U.S. But never before has there been so much innovation and startup activity outside the U.S. It feels like its moment is now. Our mission is to level the playing field. With courage and access to the best resources more international Unicorns will emerge.</p>
          <p>Here in Boston we have a bias for doers over talkers. We combine awesone teams and their innovative products with U.S. market savvy and access to capital. We complement your team with the experience required to make it in the U.S. We believe Boston to be the #1 tech hub in the U.S. for European entrepreneurs and we are ready to prove it.</p>
          <p>Our program aggregates experience and wisdom from the best into a structured curriculum adapted to your specific needs. It is a fast track to catching up with the leading edge. Our value-add translates into immediate results and a measurable return.</p>

          <h2>The battleground is the U.S.</h2>
          <p>“For most of our companies in enterprise or infrastructure, the battleground is still the U.S. We push our software entrepreneurs to be present and aggressive in the US market from the earliest of stages. America is where the toughest competition lies, and competition makes you stronger. America is where most of the acquirers are, and you have to bring the fight to them to get bought.”</p>

          <h2>We partner with entrepreneurs who want to get ahead</h2>
          <p>What works in your home market might not work in the U.S. Many things are different. It is a different culture, a much larger market with more competition and experienced investors. Getting ahead requires getting immersed. It is about smart work and not just hard work. It's about having a local partner.</p>
          <p>Our approach is first focused on product. We help you test for demand. Then we work with you to adjust market segmentation and messaging. Likely the competitive dynamics are different and require a narrower definition of your market and target persona. We assume you have a product available in your local market. We are experienced with metrication, measuring user engagement based on cohort analysis. Based on that data we enter into an iterative process to make your product a great fit for users.</p>
          <p>Once the product is tracking and we are seeing the good metrics, we focus on your go-to-market strategy. Scaling users can be learned. It is based on marketing automation, growth hacks, inbound campaigns combined with inside sales. We show you our choice of the latest tools and best-practices used by the best. If done right and with access to U.S. capital your company will grow fast.</p>
